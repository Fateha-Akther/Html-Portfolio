<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am a student at George Brown College, currently living in Toronto. <br>
    During the pandemic, I was in Bangladesh, and later I moved to Winnipeg <br>
    before settling in Toronto in 2024. I have experience in customer service <br>
    and sales roles, including working at Rani Jewelry and Safeway Pembina <br>
    Village.I am skilled in Python, Bash scripting, and coding, with a <br>
    preference for using PyCharm as my development tool . I appreciate <br>
    simple and relatable language in my assignments, often connecting <br>
    them to my personal experiences in Bangladesh.</p>
